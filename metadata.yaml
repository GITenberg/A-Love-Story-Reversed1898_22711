description: As the nineteenth century drew to a close and the twentieth century loomed
  ahead, many shifts were occurring in social modes and mores. American author Edward
  Bellamy perfectly encapsulates the tensions of that turbulent time in ""A Love Story
  Reversed, "" a charming tale in which a newly emboldened young woman elects to take
  the upper hand when it comes to cultivating a slowly blossoming romance.
